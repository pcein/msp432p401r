# Note on SVD files

The API is auto-generated from SVD files provided by Texas Instruments. The SVD files
are available from: 

http://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/msp430_public_sw/mcu/msp430/msp432cmsis/latest/exports/TexasInstruments.MSP432P4xx_DFP.3.2.2.pack

Several SVD files are provided for various members of the MSP432 family; out of these, the svd files for
MSP432P401R and MSP432P401M are exactly similar, except for a field which specifies the name of the processor.
